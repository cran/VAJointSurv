Description: Estimates joint marker (longitudinal) and
    and survival (time-to-event) outcomes using variational approximations.
    The package supports multivariate markers allowing for
    correlated error terms and multiple types of survival outcomes which may be
    left-truncated, right-censored, and recurrent. Time-varying fixed and
    random covariate effects are supported along with non-proportional hazards.
